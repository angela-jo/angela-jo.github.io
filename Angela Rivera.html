            <h4>More about me...</h4>
            <p>I have been learning more about:
            <ul id="coding">
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
                <li>Figma</li>
                <li>+ HTML</li>
                <li>+ CSS</li>
                <li>+ UI/UX</li>

            <h4>What am I learning in CSS?</h4>
            <p>
                A few years ago I took a web development course and flunked it royally.
                I am a hands-on learner, so I jumped right into the coding exercises without reading about the concepts
                and rules.
                It cost me a lot of money and time. I spent hours debugging because I did not initially understand the
                relationship between CSS and HTML.</p>

            <p>All in all, getting back into coding has been a great experience. Visit my page again to see how I am
                using what I learn in real time!</p>

            <h4>JavaScript, say what?!</h4>
            <p>I cannot believe it, but I just learned how to use the type.js JavaScript library that will type out
                different adjectives for you like a typewriter. You can see my work at the top of this page! It took me
                a few weeks, a lot of questions, a lot of tinkering to figure it out. The most important lesson I
                learned: NEVER give up!</p>

            <h4>Motorcycle Life</h4>
            <div>
                <p>
                    It's true, indeed. I have a moto license. It's almost been 2 years since I bought my first
                    motorcycle.
                    I am addicted. Riding season is around the corner, and like many other motorcycle heads, we are
                    always thinking about riding!
                    Do you ride?
